LIXA (LIbre XA) is an open source and free Transaction Manager implementing the distributed transaction processing
"XA specification" and "TX (transaction demarcation) specification" according to the X/Open CAE Specification.
 LIXA is a Transaction Manager but it's not a Transaction Monitor: this is the distinguishing feature of the project.
  LIXA technology enables every application container, like a web server or a shell,
   to become an XA compliant application server.
    The client/server architecture of LIXA allows many application containers to share a single LIXA (state) server:
    this is ideal when horizontal scalability is a must and many identical application containers must refer to a single
     transactional environment. Performance, scalability and high availability are key features of the project.
      LIXA can be used with the C, C++, and PHP programming languages.
